I have been a self proclaimed computer guy ever since my father showed me games as early as I can remember. I have been a self proclaimed programmer ever since I found the game Roblox at around 11-12. Ever since then I have been active in learning programming and now I am no longer self proclaimed, but bona fide. I am continuing on to receive my Masters now and having a blast.\n\nOther than that I love to climb, edit videos, and of course play games online, thanks for checking me out!",
