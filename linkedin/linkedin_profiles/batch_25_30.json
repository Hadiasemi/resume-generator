My academic background is complemented by diverse work experiences across various environments, which have honed my adaptability and problem-solving skills.\n\nI possess strong data analytics skills, demonstrated by my proficiency in Excel and the Microsoft Office suite. I am eager to apply my abilities to deliver efficient and high-quality work in any role.\n\nIn my spare time, I rebuilt a car (A 2003 VW GTI) in which I am quite proud of. In addition I for fun built a website to review the best attributes of cars, catering to car enthusiasts, like myself, allowing them to share, and enjoy their hobby and passion. I also have worked hard and founded my very own multi-media company for political science related topics for the many like me who are interested in its diverse subjects and to familiarize myself with the media production industry and process.\n\nWhether working on continuing to be a life long learner, my work, and personal projects and hobbies, I apply my proven tenacity, problem-solving, and analytical skills.",
