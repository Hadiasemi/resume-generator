        "about": "Hi, my name is Grant Johnson and I'm a Software Engineer with a focus on Full Stack Development. I studied at Cal Poly, SLO where I graduated summa cum laude with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science.\n\nI decided to enter the software engineering field after taking a programming course while studying aerospace engineering. That course was my first introduction to programming and it felt so natural! I decided to switch my course of study to enter a field that permeates virtually every industry. The possibility of working on technologies across different industries was so exciting to me!\n\nEvery project I work on in my free time is a result of me thinking \"man, I wish there was a something that could do that!\" I love working on passion projects like these and solving problems we face in everyday life. Now, my primary desire is to contribute on projects that leave a genuine impact on the world.\n\nFeel free to visit my portfolio site to see some of the projects I've worked on thus far.",

Whether it's backpacking the Grand Canyon, taking cooking classes in Japan, swimming with sharks, or cliff-jumping along the Amalfi Coast, I love exploring and embodying Cal Poly's \"Learn by Doing\" spirit.\n\nI'm super excited to be joining AWS as a Cloud Support Associate this fall. Diving into the world of cloud computing with such an innovative company is a dream come true.\n\nIf you'd like to chat about my journey or share some of your own, feel free to drop me a message!",
