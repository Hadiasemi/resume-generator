        "about": "I'm a dedicated graduate student at Cal Poly SLO, majoring in Statistics with a cross-disciplinary minor in Data Science. As part of the blended BS/MS program, I'm on track to earn my Master of Science in Statistics, set to graduate in June 2025.\n\nMy academic journey has been enriched by grading for esteemed professors within the Statistics department and contributing to a pivotal research projects on confidence intervals for the negative hypergeometric distribution adn statistics education through the FROST research program. Professionally, I've gained invaluable experience as a Catastrophe Co-op at Guy Carpenter. Beyond academia and the corporate world, I hold a California Real Estate License and have a keen interest in the real estate sector.\n\nData visualization is a particular passion of mine. I take pride in crafting compelling dashboards that present complex data in an accessible and engaging manner. Outside the realm of work and study, I'm an avid traveler with a love for skiing, pickleball, Formula 1, and soccer. Exploring new places and indulging in these sports keeps me balanced and inspired.\n\nAs I approach graduation, I am actively seeking full-time opportunities where I can apply my skills and continue to grow professionally.",
