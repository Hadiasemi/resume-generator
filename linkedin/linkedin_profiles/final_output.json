        "about": "I'm a dedicated graduate student at Cal Poly SLO, majoring in Statistics with a cross-disciplinary minor in Data Science. As part of the blended BS/MS program, I'm on track to earn my Master of Science in Statistics, set to graduate in June 2025.\n\nMy academic journey has been enriched by grading for esteemed professors within the Statistics department and contributing to a pivotal research projects on confidence intervals for the negative hypergeometric distribution adn statistics education through the FROST research program. Professionally, I've gained invaluable experience as a Catastrophe Co-op at Guy Carpenter. Beyond academia and the corporate world, I hold a California Real Estate License and have a keen interest in the real estate sector.\n\nData visualization is a particular passion of mine. I take pride in crafting compelling dashboards that present complex data in an accessible and engaging manner. Outside the realm of work and study, I'm an avid traveler with a love for skiing, pickleball, Formula 1, and soccer. Exploring new places and indulging in these sports keeps me balanced and inspired.\n\nAs I approach graduation, I am actively seeking full-time opportunities where I can apply my skills and continue to grow professionally.",

I have been a self proclaimed computer guy ever since my father showed me games as early as I can remember. I have been a self proclaimed programmer ever since I found the game Roblox at around 11-12. Ever since then I have been active in learning programming and now I am no longer self proclaimed, but bona fide. I am continuing on to receive my Masters now and having a blast.\n\nOther than that I love to climb, edit videos, and of course play games online, thanks for checking me out!",

My academic background is complemented by diverse work experiences across various environments, which have honed my adaptability and problem-solving skills.\n\nI possess strong data analytics skills, demonstrated by my proficiency in Excel and the Microsoft Office suite. I am eager to apply my abilities to deliver efficient and high-quality work in any role.\n\nIn my spare time, I rebuilt a car (A 2003 VW GTI) in which I am quite proud of. In addition I for fun built a website to review the best attributes of cars, catering to car enthusiasts, like myself, allowing them to share, and enjoy their hobby and passion. I also have worked hard and founded my very own multi-media company for political science related topics for the many like me who are interested in its diverse subjects and to familiarize myself with the media production industry and process.\n\nWhether working on continuing to be a life long learner, my work, and personal projects and hobbies, I apply my proven tenacity, problem-solving, and analytical skills.",

I studied at Cal Poly, SLO where I graduated summa cum laude with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science.\n\nI decided to enter the software engineering field after taking a programming course while studying aerospace engineering. That course was my first introduction to programming and it felt so natural! I decided to switch my course of study to enter a field that permeates virtually every industry. The possibility of working on technologies across different industries was so exciting to me!\n\nEvery project I work on in my free time is a result of me thinking \"man, I wish there was a something that could do that!\" I love working on passion projects like these and solving problems we face in everyday life. Now, my primary desire is to contribute on projects that leave a genuine impact on the world.\n\nFeel free to visit my portfolio site to see some of the projects I've worked on thus far.",

My academic journey has taken me from designing space flight hardware to creating apps for firefighters, blending electrical engineering and computer science along the way.\n\nWhen I'm not knee-deep in tech, I'm all about embracing new adventures! Whether it's backpacking the Grand Canyon, taking cooking classes in Japan, swimming with sharks, or cliff-jumping along the Amalfi Coast, I love exploring and embodying Cal Poly's \"Learn by Doing\" spirit.\n\nI'm super excited to be joining AWS as a Cloud Support Associate this fall. Diving into the world of cloud computing with such an innovative company is a dream come true.\n\nIf you'd like to chat about my journey or share some of your own, feel free to drop me a message!",

With experience building intuitive mobile applications using SwiftUI and React Native, I\u2019m passionate about more than just writing code\u2014I\u2019m committed to understanding and solving the deeper challenges that users and stakeholders face.\n\nWhat sets me apart is my ability to see beyond the technical aspects of development. I approach problems holistically, considering not only the functionality but also the user experience, the design intricacies, and the pain points that might otherwise go unnoticed. Through my work on projects like the Poly Canyon app, I\u2019ve managed the entire development lifecycle\u2014from ideation and design to deployment and iteration\u2014ensuring that every step aligns with the needs of users and stakeholders.\n\nWhile my current focus is on mobile development, I\u2019m also eager to expand my expertise in AI and psychology, using those fields to create even more comprehensive solutions in the future. My long-term goal is to master these interdisciplinary areas to tackle more complex, human-centered challenges.",
